"""conversation_logger.py — structured conversation logging for the live
PersonaPlex + IMTalker pipeline.

Three outputs, all append-only (never truncated/overwritten while the
process is alive; each server run gets its own timestamped session_id, so
older sessions' files are never touched either):

  1. Console (stdout, already captured into live_server.log by the launch
     notebook) -- short one-line-per-event summaries.
  2. `conversation_<session>.log` / `.jsonl` -- the same short events, as
     text and as machine-parseable JSON lines, for scripts/dashboards.
  3. `latency_<session>.log` / `.jsonl` -- the dedicated timing/latency file
     (see latency_logger.py, exposed here as `self.latency`): where every
     second between "the user stopped speaking" and "the assistant finished
     answering" was spent, per component, plus the token counts of what the
     compressor produced. Kept separate because interleaving per-stage timings
     with transcripts and narrative made both unreadable.
  4. `detailed_<session>.log` -- a plain-English, step-by-step narrative of
     every request: what the user said, what the assistant decided to do,
     whether it decided a web search was needed and why, every search
     attempted (with scores and running counts), why and how a summary was
     created, exactly what was fed to the model and how, what it answered,
     and the "thinking sound" start/stop/loop detail. Written so a
     non-technical reader can follow the whole story of a single request top
     to bottom without needing to know what a router, an embedding, or a
     token is.

Thread-safety: called from both the GPU thread and the background
routing/search thread (see MoshiOnlyEngineWithHidden._route_and_search in
the AHAudioPace script). `logging.Logger`/`Handler` are internally thread-safe; the JSONL
and detailed-narrative write paths take their own lock. The turn-machine
these are called from only ever has one request in flight at a time, so the
detailed log's events arrive in true chronological order -- no buffering or
reordering needed to keep the narrative readable.
